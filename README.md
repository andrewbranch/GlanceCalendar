# Glance Calendar

Glance Calendar is a menu bar app that replaces the default system clock and includes a simple month view in the menu. It aims to look as native as possible, supporting both light and dark system appearances. It’s currently unfinished. If the latest commit is within a month, it’s under active development. Otherwise, it will rot here forever. I make no promises.
